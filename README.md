-   npm install
-   npm run start

example URL:

http://localhost:3002/

What is missing

-   instead scaling i should scroll the container
-   i should use a real asset (currently is difficult to understand where it's rotated) but shoot and you will see :D
-   the hays are yellow
-   the walls are white
